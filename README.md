# Data-Structures-Implementation-
This project includes the development of the program that stores and manage the data using four different data structures as Arrays, Linked Lists, Hash Tables (Quadratic Probing)and Binary Trees.

Following operations are implemented on the given data:
1.Insert all of the given data in a data structure.
2.Print data of data structure in sorted order (traverse in sorted order) (numerically or alphabetically).
3.Find records.
4.Delete half of the data from the data structure.

Execution time and memory consumption for each operation is measured. Operations on different data structures depending on their execution time and memory consumption are compared. 

At end, the data structure which is the best for each operation is concluded.
